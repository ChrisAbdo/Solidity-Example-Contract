# Solidity-Example-Contract
This is a Solidity program designed to allow users to upload any form of media onto the Ethereum blockchain. This Smart Contract is a base template for many of my upcoming projects.
Included is a sample test file to ensure that the contract is functioning properly. To utilize these, please make sure you have any blockchain development dependencies already installed (such as Truffle or Hardhat)
